- Advisory fees are **billed quarterly in arrears** and deducted directly from your account, unless you request invoicing.
- You will receive a detailed fee statement each quarter showing the calculation methodology and total amount billed.

## What's Included

Our management fee covers:
- Ongoing investment management and portfolio rebalancing
- Quarterly performance reporting
- Semi-annual advisory meetings (in-person or virtual)
- Access to our secure client portal
- Unlimited phone and email support from your advisory team
- Tax-loss harvesting in taxable accounts

## Fee Negotiation

Fees may be negotiable based on the complexity of your financial situation, the total relationship size across related accounts, and other factors. Multi-generational family relationships may qualify for preferential fee arrangements.

## Additional Costs

In addition to our advisory fees, your accounts will incur:
- **Custodian fees**: Charged by Charles Schwab (our primary custodian) for account maintenance and transaction processing
