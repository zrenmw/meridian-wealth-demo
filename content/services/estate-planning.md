## Preserving Your Legacy

Estate planning ensures that your wealth is distributed according to your wishes while minimizing tax liability and administrative burden for your heirs.

### Our Estate Planning Services

**Estate Plan Review & Coordination**
We work alongside your estate attorney to review and coordinate your will, trusts, beneficiary designations, and powers of attorney. Our role is to ensure your estate plan is aligned with your overall financial strategy.

**Trust Planning**
We provide guidance on various trust structures, including:
- Revocable living trusts
- Irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILITs)
- Grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs)
- Charitable remainder trusts (CRTs)
- Dynasty trusts for multi-generational wealth transfer

**Gifting Strategies**
We help you develop tax-efficient gifting strategies using annual exclusions, lifetime exemptions, 529 education savings plans, and charitable giving vehicles.

**Charitable Planning**
For clients with philanthropic goals, we design charitable giving strategies using donor-advised funds, private foundations, and charitable trusts that maximize both your impact and tax benefits.

**Business Succession Planning**
If you own a business, we help plan for orderly succession through buy-sell agreements, key person insurance, and transition strategies.

### Important Considerations

Estate tax laws are subject to change. The current federal estate tax exemption is $13.61 million per individual (2024), but this amount may change with future legislation. We monitor legislative developments and proactively communicate any necessary adjustments to your estate plan.
