## A Holistic Approach to Your Financial Life

Wealth planning at Meridian goes beyond portfolio management. We take a comprehensive view of your financial life, integrating investment strategy, tax planning, risk management, and estate considerations into a single cohesive plan.

### What We Offer

**Investment Policy Development**
We work with you to develop a customized Investment Policy Statement (IPS) that defines your objectives, risk tolerance, time horizon, and liquidity needs. This document serves as the foundation for all investment decisions.

**Asset Allocation & Portfolio Construction**
Using institutional-grade research and modern portfolio theory, we construct diversified portfolios designed to achieve your target returns while managing downside risk. Our portfolios span traditional equities and fixed income as well as alternative investments where appropriate.

**Tax-Efficient Investing**
We employ strategies including tax-loss harvesting, asset location optimization, and municipal bond allocation to minimize the tax impact on your investment returns.

**Risk Management**
We conduct regular stress tests and scenario analyses to ensure your portfolio can withstand market disruptions. Our risk management framework considers market risk, concentration risk, liquidity risk, and inflation risk.

**Ongoing Monitoring & Rebalancing**
Your portfolio is continuously monitored and rebalanced to maintain alignment with your IPS. You receive quarterly performance reports and meet with your advisory team at least semi-annually.

### Our Investment Philosophy

We believe in:
- **Evidence-based investing** grounded in academic research
- **Diversification** across asset classes, geographies, and strategies
- **Cost efficiency** through a blend of active and passive management
- **Discipline** through systematic rebalancing and long-term focus
- **Transparency** in all investment decisions and fee structures

### Minimum Account Size

Our wealth planning services require a minimum investable asset base of $250,000. For accounts below $1,000,000, an annual financial planning fee applies. See our [Fee Schedule](/fee-schedule/) for complete details.
