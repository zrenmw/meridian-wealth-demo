## Planning for the Next Chapter

Retirement planning is about more than accumulating assets — it's about ensuring you can maintain your lifestyle, pursue your passions, and leave a legacy on your terms.

### Our Retirement Planning Process

**1. Retirement Readiness Assessment**
We begin with a comprehensive analysis of your current financial position, projected expenses, income sources (Social Security, pensions, annuities), and anticipated retirement date.

**2. Income Strategy Design**
We develop a sustainable withdrawal strategy that balances your income needs against longevity risk, inflation, and market volatility. This includes optimizing the sequence of withdrawals across taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts.

**3. Social Security Optimization**
Our analysis considers all available claiming strategies for you and your spouse to maximize your lifetime Social Security benefits. The optimal strategy depends on your health, other income sources, and estate planning goals.

**4. Healthcare Planning**
We help you plan for healthcare costs in retirement, including Medicare enrollment strategy, supplemental insurance options, and long-term care planning.

**5. Tax-Efficient Distribution Planning**
We develop a multi-year tax projection to identify opportunities for Roth conversions, capital gain harvesting, and other strategies that can reduce your lifetime tax burden.
