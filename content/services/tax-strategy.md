## Beyond Tax Preparation

Tax strategy at Meridian is proactive, not reactive. We work year-round to identify opportunities that reduce your current and future tax liability.

### Our Tax Strategy Services

**Year-Round Tax Planning**
We don't wait until April to think about your taxes. Our team conducts quarterly tax projections and identifies planning opportunities throughout the year.

**Tax-Loss Harvesting**
We systematically harvest losses in taxable accounts to offset gains, reducing your annual tax bill while maintaining your target asset allocation.

**Roth Conversion Analysis**
We model multi-year Roth conversion strategies to determine the optimal amount and timing of conversions based on your current and projected tax brackets.

**Charitable Giving Optimization**
We structure charitable contributions to maximize tax benefits, including bunching strategies, qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) from IRAs, and appreciated stock donations.

**State Tax Planning**
For clients with residences or income in multiple states, we analyze state tax implications and develop strategies to minimize overall state tax liability.

### Quarterly Tax Strategy Updates

Each quarter, our tax team publishes updated guidance reflecting the latest regulatory changes and planning opportunities. These updates are shared exclusively with our clients and posted in our [Insights](/insights/) section.

### Coordination with Your CPA

While Meridian does not prepare tax returns, we work closely with your CPA or tax preparer to ensure our strategies are properly implemented. We provide detailed year-end tax packets and are available for direct consultation with your tax professional.
