## Fourth Quarter Highlights

The fourth quarter of 2025 capped off a year characterized by remarkable market resilience in the face of persistent macroeconomic uncertainty. The S&P 500 gained 4.2% in Q4, bringing full-year returns to 18.7%.

### Equity Markets

U.S. large-cap equities continued their strong performance, driven by:

- **Technology sector strength**: AI-related investments continued to fuel growth in mega-cap technology companies, with the sector contributing approximately 40% of total S&P 500 returns
- **Broadening participation**: Encouragingly, market breadth improved in Q4 as mid-cap and small-cap stocks began to participate in the rally
- **International recovery**: Developed international markets (MSCI EAFE) gained 3.1% in Q4, showing signs of narrowing the valuation gap with U.S. equities

### Fixed Income

The bond market experienced a more nuanced quarter:

- The 10-year Treasury yield settled in the 4.2%-4.5% range, reflecting the market's expectation of a measured Fed easing cycle
- Investment-grade corporate bonds delivered solid income with minimal spread widening
- Municipal bonds remained attractive on a tax-equivalent basis for high-bracket investors

### Alternative Investments

- Real estate investment trusts (REITs) rallied 6.8% in Q4 as rate expectations moderated
- Private credit continued to attract institutional flows, offering yield premiums over public markets
- Commodities were mixed, with gold reaching new highs while energy prices remained volatile

## Portfolio Implications

As we enter 2026, our investment committee has identified several key themes:

1. **Maintain diversification**: While U.S. large-caps have dominated, we believe international and mid-cap exposure will be rewarded as valuations normalize
2. **Duration management**: With rates potentially declining, we are gradually extending fixed-income duration
3. **Quality focus**: In this stage of the cycle, we favor high-quality companies with strong balance sheets and sustainable earnings growth
4. **Alternative allocation**: We continue to recommend a 10-20% allocation to alternatives for qualified clients

## Looking Ahead

We will publish our full 2026 Market Outlook in the coming weeks. In the meantime, we encourage clients to schedule a portfolio review with their advisory team to ensure alignment with your investment policy statement.
