## The Fiduciary Standard

When selecting a financial advisor, one of the most important questions to ask is: "Are you a fiduciary?" The answer has significant implications for the advice you receive and the fees you pay.

### Fiduciary vs. Suitability

**Fiduciary Standard (RIA firms like Meridian):**
- Must act in the client's best interest at all times
- Must disclose all conflicts of interest
- Must disclose all compensation arrangements
- Cannot receive hidden commissions or revenue-sharing payments

**Suitability Standard (broker-dealers):**
- Must recommend investments that are "suitable" for the client
- Suitable does not mean optimal or lowest cost
- May receive commissions and revenue-sharing payments
- Conflicts of interest may exist but need only be disclosed in fine print

### Why It Matters

Consider this example: A client with $1 million to invest approaches two different advisors.

**Advisor A (fiduciary)** recommends a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds and ETFs with an all-in cost of 0.30% per year, plus the advisor's 0.95% management fee. Total annual cost: approximately $12,500.

**Advisor B (suitability)** recommends a portfolio of proprietary mutual funds with an average expense ratio of 1.25%, plus various account fees. The advisor receives a 1% upfront commission and 0.25% trailing commission. Total first-year cost: approximately $22,500.

Both recommendations may be "suitable," but only one is truly in the client's best interest.

2. Do you receive any compensation other than the fees I pay directly?
