## Rethinking Retirement Income

The 4% rule — withdrawing 4% of your portfolio in the first year of retirement and adjusting for inflation thereafter — has been a retirement planning staple for decades. But is it still the best approach?

### Why the 4% Rule May Fall Short

- It was designed for a 30-year retirement horizon — many of our clients may need income for 35+ years
- It doesn't account for variable spending patterns in retirement
- It assumes a static asset allocation, which may not be optimal
- It doesn't consider the tax implications of different withdrawal strategies

### Strategy 1: The Bucket Approach

Divide your portfolio into three "buckets" based on time horizon:
- **Bucket 1 (Years 1-3)**: Cash and short-term bonds for immediate income needs
- **Bucket 2 (Years 4-10)**: Intermediate bonds and balanced funds for medium-term needs
- **Bucket 3 (Years 10+)**: Growth-oriented investments for long-term appreciation

This approach provides psychological comfort during market downturns while maintaining growth potential.

### Strategy 2: Dynamic Withdrawal Rates

Instead of a fixed percentage, adjust withdrawals based on market performance:
- In strong market years, withdraw up to 5%
- In down markets, reduce to 3% or less
- This flexibility can significantly improve portfolio longevity

### Strategy 3: Income Floor + Upside

Create a guaranteed income "floor" using Social Security, pensions, and annuities to cover essential expenses. Then invest remaining assets for growth to fund discretionary spending and legacy goals.

### Strategy 4: Tax-Bracket Management

Coordinate withdrawals across taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free accounts to minimize your lifetime tax burden:
- Withdraw from taxable accounts first to allow tax-advantaged accounts to continue growing
- Fill up lower tax brackets with Roth conversions in low-income years
- Use qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) from IRAs after age 70½

### Strategy 5: Asset-Liability Matching

For clients with predictable expenses, we can create a bond ladder or structured income portfolio that matches specific cash flow needs to specific investments, reducing sequence-of-returns risk.

### Which Strategy Is Right for You?

The optimal strategy depends on your specific situation, including your total wealth, income needs, tax situation, health, and legacy goals. Most of our clients benefit from a combination of these approaches.
