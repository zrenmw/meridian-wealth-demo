## Key Tax Changes for 2026

The new tax year brings several important changes that may impact high-net-worth individuals and families. Here's what you need to know and how to prepare.

### Retirement Account Updates

**Increased Contribution Limits:**
- 401(k) elective deferral: $23,500 (up from $23,000)
- IRA contribution limit: $7,000 (unchanged)
- Catch-up contributions (age 50+): $7,500 for 401(k), $1,000 for IRA

**Required Minimum Distributions:**
- The SECURE 2.0 Act continues its phased increase of the RMD age. Individuals turning 73 in 2026 must begin taking distributions.
- New for 2026: Roth accounts in employer plans are no longer subject to RMDs during the account owner's lifetime.

### Estate and Gift Tax

- The federal estate tax exemption remains elevated at approximately $13.99 million per individual for 2026
- **Critical planning note**: The elevated exemption is scheduled to sunset after 2025 under current law, but legislative action in late 2025 extended it through 2026. Clients with estates approaching this threshold should review their planning immediately.
- Annual gift tax exclusion: $19,000 per recipient (up from $18,000)

### Capital Gains Considerations

- Long-term capital gains rates remain at 0%, 15%, and 20% based on income thresholds
- The Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) of 3.8% continues to apply to higher-income taxpayers
- State-level capital gains taxes vary — New York clients should be aware of the combined federal/state rate exceeding 30%

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Roth Conversion Planning
With tax rates potentially rising in future years, 2026 may represent an opportune window for Roth conversions. We recommend analyzing your projected income to identify conversion amounts that keep you within favorable brackets.

### 2. Charitable Giving Optimization
Consider bunching charitable contributions using a donor-advised fund to maximize itemized deduction benefits in alternating years.

### 3. Estate Plan Review
Given the uncertainty around the estate tax exemption sunset, all clients with estates exceeding $7 million should schedule an estate plan review.

### 4. Tax-Loss Harvesting
Our team continuously monitors portfolios for tax-loss harvesting opportunities. If you hold concentrated positions with significant unrealized gains, ask your advisor about systematic diversification strategies.
