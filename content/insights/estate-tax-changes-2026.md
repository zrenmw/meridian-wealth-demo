## Legislative Update

Recent legislative developments have introduced significant changes to the estate tax landscape that may affect your wealth transfer planning. Here's what you need to know.

### Key Changes

**Estate Tax Exemption**
The federal estate tax exemption, which was scheduled to revert to approximately $7 million per individual in 2026, has been addressed by new legislation. The current elevated exemption of approximately $13.99 million per individual has been extended, but with modifications:

- The exemption will remain at approximately $14 million through 2028
- A new phase-down is scheduled to reduce the exemption to $10 million (inflation-adjusted) beginning in 2029
- Portability of unused exemption between spouses remains in effect

**Gift Tax Adjustments**
- The lifetime gift tax exemption remains unified with the estate tax exemption
- Annual exclusion gifts increase to $19,000 per recipient
- New reporting requirements apply to gifts to foreign trusts exceeding $100,000

**Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax**
- The GST tax exemption remains aligned with the estate tax exemption
- New rules may affect existing dynasty trusts created under prior exemption levels

### Impact Assessment

| Estate Size | Prior Law Impact | New Law Impact | Action Needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Under $7M | No federal estate tax | No federal estate tax | Minimal |
| $7M - $14M | Potentially taxable after sunset | Protected through 2028 | Review planning |
| $14M - $28M (couple) | Protected by portability | Protected through 2028 | Active planning recommended |
| Over $28M | Taxable above exemption | Taxable above exemption | Aggressive planning |

### Recommended Actions

**For estates under $14 million:**
Review your current plan to ensure it still reflects your wishes. Even if federal estate tax is not a concern, state estate taxes (which may have lower thresholds) should be considered.

**For estates between $14-28 million:**
The window of opportunity is narrowing. Consider:
- Maximizing annual exclusion gifts
- Establishing irrevocable trusts to lock in current exemption levels
- Reviewing life insurance needs and trust structures

**For estates over $28 million:**
Comprehensive planning is critical:
- GRATs and other valuation discount strategies
- Charitable planning to reduce taxable estate
- Dynasty trust planning for multi-generational wealth transfer
- Review of existing trust structures for optimization opportunities

### Timeline for Action

We recommend all clients with estates exceeding $7 million schedule a planning review by June 30, 2026, to take advantage of current exemption levels and implement any necessary strategies.
