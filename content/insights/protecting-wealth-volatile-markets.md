## Embracing Volatility

Market volatility is not a bug — it's a feature of investing. While unsettling, volatility creates opportunities for disciplined investors and is the price of admission for long-term equity returns.

### Historical Perspective

Since 1950, the S&P 500 has experienced:
- An average intra-year decline of 14.3%
- A positive annual return in 73% of calendar years
- An average annual return of approximately 10.5% including dividends

This means that in a typical year, investors who panic and sell during a downturn would have missed the subsequent recovery.

### Our Volatility Management Framework

**1. Strategic Asset Allocation**
Your Investment Policy Statement defines a long-term target allocation based on your goals and risk tolerance. We maintain this allocation through market cycles, rebalancing when positions drift beyond defined thresholds.

**2. Systematic Rebalancing**
When markets decline, rebalancing naturally buys more of what has become cheaper. When markets surge, it trims what has become expensive. This disciplined approach has historically added 0.5-1.0% in annual returns over time.

**3. Tax-Loss Harvesting**
Volatility creates tax-loss harvesting opportunities. When positions decline, we can realize losses to offset gains elsewhere in your portfolio, reducing your tax liability while maintaining market exposure.

**4. Quality Bias**
We maintain a bias toward high-quality companies with strong balance sheets, consistent earnings, and competitive advantages. These companies tend to outperform during downturns and recover more quickly.

**5. Liquidity Management**
We ensure your portfolio maintains sufficient liquidity to meet your cash flow needs without being forced to sell at unfavorable prices.

### What Not to Do

- **Don't try to time the market**: Missing just the 10 best trading days over a 20-year period can cut your returns in half
- **Don't chase performance**: Last year's winners are often next year's laggards
- **Don't check your portfolio daily**: Frequent monitoring increases anxiety and the temptation to make emotional decisions
- **Don't confuse volatility with risk**: True risk is the permanent loss of capital, not temporary price fluctuations

### Our Commitment

During periods of heightened volatility, we increase our communication frequency. You can expect:
- Timely market commentary from our investment committee
- Portfolio impact assessments for significant market moves
- Proactive outreach from your advisory team
- Availability for ad-hoc calls to discuss concerns

*Market volatility is inevitable, but financial planning failures are not. Stay the course, and let your plan work for you.*
