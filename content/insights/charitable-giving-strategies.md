## Giving Strategically

Philanthropy is a deeply personal endeavor. At Meridian, we believe strategic planning can amplify both your charitable impact and your financial benefits.

### Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs)

A donor-advised fund allows you to:
- Make a charitable contribution and receive an immediate tax deduction
- Invest the funds for tax-free growth
- Distribute grants to qualified charities over time
- Maintain advisory privileges over the distribution of funds

**Best for:** Clients who want flexibility in their giving timeline or who wish to "bunch" contributions for tax optimization.

### Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)

If you are over 70½ and have an IRA, QCDs allow you to:
- Distribute up to $105,000 directly from your IRA to qualified charities
- Exclude the distribution from taxable income
- Satisfy your required minimum distribution (if applicable)
- Avoid the AGI increase that a normal distribution would cause

**Best for:** Clients who are charitably inclined and want to minimize the tax impact of IRA distributions.

### Appreciated Securities

Donating appreciated securities (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) instead of cash provides a double tax benefit:
- You receive a deduction for the full fair market value
- You avoid paying capital gains tax on the appreciation
- The charity receives the full value of the security

**Best for:** Clients with significant unrealized gains in taxable accounts.

### Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs)

A CRT provides:
- An income stream to you for life or a term of years
- A partial charitable income tax deduction at the time of contribution
- Estate tax reduction as the trust assets are removed from your estate
- The remainder passes to your designated charity

**Best for:** Clients seeking income in retirement while supporting charitable causes.

### Private Foundations

For clients with significant philanthropic goals, a private foundation offers:
- Complete control over grant-making decisions
- The ability to involve family members in philanthropic activities
- A lasting legacy vehicle for multi-generational giving
- Employment of family members (with reasonable compensation)

**Best for:** Clients planning to give $1 million or more over time who want maximum control and family involvement.

### Tax Planning Integration

We coordinate charitable giving strategies with your overall tax plan:
- Bunching contributions in high-income years
- Timing gifts of appreciated securities for maximum tax benefit
- Coordinating with estate planning to maximize the impact of charitable bequests
- Annual giving plan development aligned with your financial goals

*Consult with your tax advisor to determine which strategies are most appropriate for your specific situation.*
