## Why a Will Isn't Enough

Many high-net-worth individuals believe that having a will is sufficient estate planning. While a will is an essential foundation, it's only one piece of a comprehensive estate plan. Here's why — and what else you should consider.

### The Limitations of a Will

- **Probate**: Assets passing through a will must go through probate, which is public, time-consuming, and potentially expensive
- **No incapacity planning**: A will only takes effect at death — it doesn't help if you become incapacitated
- **Limited control**: A will provides a one-time distribution, with no ongoing management or protection of assets for beneficiaries
- **State-specific**: Wills are governed by state law, which can create complications for clients with property in multiple states

### Advanced Strategies We Recommend

**Revocable Living Trust**
A revocable living trust allows you to maintain full control of your assets during your lifetime while avoiding probate and providing seamless management in the event of incapacity.

**Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)**
An ILIT removes life insurance proceeds from your taxable estate, potentially saving millions in estate taxes for clients with large insurance policies.

**Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)**
A GRAT allows you to transfer appreciating assets to beneficiaries with minimal gift tax exposure. This is particularly effective in low-interest-rate environments.

**Family Limited Partnership (FLP)**
An FLP can facilitate the transfer of business interests or investment assets at discounted values, reducing gift and estate tax exposure.

**Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT)**
A CRT provides an income stream to you during your lifetime, with the remainder passing to your chosen charity. This offers immediate income tax deductions and removes assets from your taxable estate.

### The Importance of Regular Review

Estate plans should be reviewed:
- Every 3-5 years at minimum
- After major life events (marriage, divorce, birth, death)
- When tax laws change significantly
- When your net worth changes materially

### Getting Started

Estate planning is deeply personal and should be tailored to your specific situation. We recommend scheduling a meeting with your Meridian advisory team and your estate planning attorney to review your current plan and identify opportunities.
