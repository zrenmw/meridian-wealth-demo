## The Road Ahead

As we progress through 2026, the investment landscape presents both compelling opportunities and meaningful risks. Our investment committee has conducted its quarterly review and identified the following key themes.

### Economic Backdrop

The U.S. economy continues to demonstrate resilience:
- GDP growth is projected at 2.1% for 2026, down modestly from 2025's 2.5%
- The labor market remains healthy with unemployment steady at 3.9%
- Inflation has moderated to 2.4%, approaching but not yet at the Fed's 2% target
- Consumer spending remains robust, supported by a strong labor market and rising asset values

### Federal Reserve Policy

- The Fed has signaled a cautious approach to further rate reductions
- We expect 1-2 additional rate cuts in 2026, bringing the federal funds rate to 4.00-4.25%
- The yield curve has normalized, with the 10-year Treasury yielding approximately 4.3%

### Our Asset Class Views

| Asset Class | View | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| U.S. Large Cap | Neutral | Valuations elevated but earnings growth supportive |
| U.S. Mid/Small Cap | Overweight | Attractive valuations, domestic economic strength |
| International Developed | Overweight | Narrowing valuation gap, currency tailwinds |
| Emerging Markets | Neutral | Selective opportunities but geopolitical risks |
| Investment Grade Bonds | Overweight | Attractive yields, low default risk |
| High Yield Bonds | Neutral | Tight spreads limit upside |
| Real Assets | Overweight | Inflation hedge, attractive income |
| Cash | Underweight | Opportunity cost of holding cash increasing |

### Key Risks

1. **Geopolitical tensions**: Ongoing conflicts and trade policy uncertainty
2. **Valuation compression**: U.S. equity multiples remain above historical averages
3. **Policy uncertainty**: Election-year dynamics may create market volatility
4. **Commercial real estate**: Office sector challenges may impact regional banks

### Portfolio Positioning

For the quarter ahead, we are implementing the following adjustments:

- Increasing international equity allocation by 2-3% in most portfolios
- Adding duration in fixed-income allocations as rate cycle matures
- Initiating positions in infrastructure-related investments
- Maintaining defensive quality tilt in equity selections

## Client Action Items

1. **Review your IPS**: Ensure your Investment Policy Statement reflects any changes in your financial situation or goals
2. **Tax planning**: Q1 is an ideal time to begin 2026 tax planning with your advisor
3. **Rebalancing**: Market gains may have shifted your portfolio away from targets — your advisor will address this in your next review
