## Our Story

Founded in 2003 by Catherine Meridian, Meridian Wealth Advisors was built on a simple premise: that wealth management should be personal, transparent, and aligned with each client's unique vision for their financial future.

After 15 years at Goldman Sachs, Catherine recognized that many high-net-worth individuals and families were underserved by large institutions focused on product sales rather than genuine financial planning. She established Meridian Wealth Advisors to offer a different approach — one grounded in fiduciary responsibility, deep expertise, and lasting relationships.

## Our Approach

**Fiduciary First.** As a registered investment adviser, we are legally and ethically obligated to act in your best interest. We do not earn commissions on product sales, and our fee-only model ensures our advice is unbiased.

**Comprehensive Planning.** We look beyond investments to address all aspects of your financial life — retirement planning, tax optimization, estate planning, risk management, and philanthropic giving.

**Institutional-Quality Research.** Our investment committee draws on the same research and analytics tools used by major institutional investors, providing our clients with sophisticated strategies typically reserved for endowments and pension funds.

**Personalized Service.** Every client is assigned a dedicated advisory team. We maintain a deliberately limited client base to ensure each family receives the attention they deserve.
